The goal of PCA is to extract information while reducing the number of features from a dataset by identifying which existing features relate to another. The crux of the algorithm is trying to determine the relationship between existing features, called principal components, and then quantifying how relevant these principal components are. The principal components are used to transform the high dimensional data to a lower dimensional data while preserving as much information. For a principal component to be relevant, it needs to capture information about the features. We can determine the relationships between features using covariance.
